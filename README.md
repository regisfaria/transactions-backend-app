# Rocketseat Challenge #5

## Overview
  This repository was made to submit a challenge for [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) goStack bootcamp.
  In this challenge, I was asked to build a transaction backend using SOLID concepts.

  To run the app, simply insert below command.
  *Note*: You must install code dependencies before running dev command.(exemple below)
  ``` shell
  $ yarn
  $ yarn dev:server
  ```

  The api is listening on localhost:3333.
  To test API requisitions I recommennd using [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).
